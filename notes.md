# "Data Science and Machine Learning in Practice" module notes
* Module will be taught from 2nd Oct 2023 and runs for 9 weeks
* Everyone  on the module will know up to: multiple linear regression, 
k-nearest neighbours, single-predictor logistic regression
* Two 1.5 hour sessions per week, one 2 hour online lab per week.

# Module rubric

> You have already studied the foundations of data science in Quant 1B.
> This module follows on from those modules, but with a focus on real-world 
> applications of data science, working in teams to make useful, extensible and 
> reproducible data science analyses and reports on a wide variety of data, 
> including data from databases, big data, spatial data such as weather and 
> climate data, data from public services and data scraped from web pages and 
> other interfaces.  You will learn how to use the standard tools of the trade in
> collaboration and data science coding, such as text editors, version control 
> and Github, as well as the standard process for collaboration and learning in 
> code, such as code testing, code review and automated testing for each code 
> change.  You will also learn how and when to use the base libraries for data 
> science analysis, such as Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, and others.  When you 
> finish the course, you will have the training you need to join mature data
> analysis teams in industry and academia, and to set up or lead your own teams,
> using these tools and processes.

# Module plan

Week 1:
* Session 1: The Problem with Notebooks (introducing scripts + VS code).
  Show a bad data analysis project, where everything that can go wrong with
  "sending notebooks via email" does go wrong. Motivate using scripts; exercises
  involves using scripts to perform a simple analysis. 
* Session 2: Collaboration, reproducibility and testing (git, github, assert
  statements). Motivate testing using example from: 
  https://sagol-python-for-neuroscientists.github.io/textbook-public/classes/class_8/class_8.html 
  Exericse involves adding tests to analysing from session 1, collaborating 
  using github.
* Lab: computer setup clinic (installing python, git, VS code)
